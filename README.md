# AntiFreeloaderBot-DankMemer
AntiFreeloader bot is a custom freeloader system that you can configure easily! 

<h1>About the Bot</h1>
<p>This bot works easily, just configure it to what you want it to do & you got it!</p>
<h2>SelfHosting</h2>
You don't want to use **REPLIT**.

Don't use anything that is free & public to all since we don't use dotenv.

If you can't find a host, use our host **lavahosts.com**.
